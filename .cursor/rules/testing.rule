1. Test Organization:
   ```clojure
   ;; ✓ Feature-focused describes with clear contexts
   (describe "Victory conditions"
     (context "Standard patterns"
       (it "should detect horizontal wins")
       (it "should detect vertical wins"))
     (context "Extended patterns"
       (it "should detect longer sequences")))

   ;; ✗ Avoid generic/vague groupings
   (describe "Generic Operations"
     (it "should initialize"))
   ```

2. Test Structure:
   ```clojure
   ;; Clear setup and assertions
   (it "should detect wins"
       (let [board [[\X \X \X]
                    [\O \O \space]
                    [\space \space \space]]]
         ;; Test both positive and negative cases
         (should (board/check-winner board \X 3))
         (should-not (board/check-winner board \O 3))))

   ;; Use threading for complex setup
   (let [board (-> (board/init-board 9)
                  (board/place-mark 2 2 \X)
                  (board/place-mark 3 3 \X))]
     (should (board/check-winner board \X 3)))
   ```

3. Test Coverage:
   - Basic functionality first
   - Edge cases and validation
   - Complex scenarios last
   - Both success and failure cases
   - Boundary conditions

4. Pending Tests:
   ```clojure
   ;; Mark unimplemented features
   (xit "future feature"
     (pending "Not implemented yet"))

   ;; Document in-progress work
   (it "current feature"
     (pending "Implementation in progress"))
   ```

5. Best Practices:
   - One behavior per test
   - Consistent naming across suite
   - Clear test data setup
   - Independent tests
   - Descriptive failure messages
   - Group related assertions

6. Test Progression:
   ```clojure
   (describe "Feature implementation"
     ;; Core functionality
     (context "✓ Basic operations"
       (it "should create board"))
     
     ;; Edge cases
     (context "⚠ Validation"
       (xit "should handle invalid moves"))
     
     ;; Complex features
     (context "❌ Advanced features"
       (xit "should handle special cases")))
   ```

7. Test Naming Conventions:
   ```clojure
   ;; Test descriptions should be specific and behavior-focused
   (it "should validate moves within board boundaries")  ;; ✓ Clear what's being tested
   (it "should check moves")  ;; ✗ Too vague
   
   ;; Use consistent terminology across related tests
   (describe "Move mechanics"  ;; Parent concept
     (context "Move validation"  ;; Related group
       (it "should validate moves within board boundaries")
       (it "should only allow moves on empty cells")))
   ```

8. Test Data Organization:
   ```clojure
   ;; Group test setup logically with assertions
   (it "should detect horizontal wins"
       (let [board [[\X \X \X]
                    [\O \O \space]
                    [\space \space \space]]]  ;; Clear test state
         (should (board/check-winner board \X 3))
         (should-not (board/check-winner board \O 3))))  ;; Related assertions

   ;; Use threading macro for complex setup
   (it "should detect wins with longer sequences"
       (let [board (-> (board/init-board 9)  ;; Clear setup steps
                      (board/place-mark 2 2 \X)
                      (board/place-mark 3 3 \X)
                      (board/place-mark 4 4 \X))]
         (should (board/check-winner board \X 3))))
   ```

9. Test Documentation:
   ```clojure
   (describe "Game mechanics"
     ;; Document test group purpose
     (context "Move validation"  ;; Ensures moves are legal and valid
       ;; Document specific test cases
       (it "should validate moves within board boundaries"  ;; Checks board bounds
           (let [board (board/init-board 3)]
             ;; Document expected behavior
             ;; Valid moves: 0,0 to 2,2
             ;; Invalid moves: negative or >= 3
             (should (board/valid-move? board 0 0))))))
   ```

10. Test Maintenance Guidelines:
   - Keep tests focused on single behaviors
   - Use consistent naming across test suite
   - Group related tests logically
   - Test both success and failure cases
   - Include boundary condition tests
   - Use clear, descriptive test data
   - Maintain test independence

11. Test Status Tracking:
   ```clojure
   (describe "Component Implementation"
     ;; Status indicators in contexts
     (context "✓ completed features"
       (it "should work" ...))
     
     (context "⚠ in progress"
       (it "current feature"
         (pending "Implementing..."))
       (xit "next feature"))
     
     (context "❌ not started"
       (xit "future feature 1")
       (xit "future feature 2")))
   ```

12. Prioritization Pattern:
   ```clojure
   (describe "RNN Implementation"
     ;; 1. Core Operations (Implement First)
     (context "essential operations"
       (it "forward step computation"...)
       (it "basic gradient calculation"...))
     
     ;; 2. Enhanced Features (Implement Next)
     (context "advanced features"
       (xit "batch processing"...)
       (xit "sequence handling"...))
     
     ;; 3. Optimizations (Implement Last)
     (context "optimizations"
       (xit "GPU acceleration"...)
       (xit "parallel processing"...)))
   ```

13. Debug-Driven Test Implementation:
   ```clojure
   (it "gradient computation"
     (if (not implemented?)
       (do
         (debug "Current implementation status:")
         (debug "- Forward pass: complete")
         (debug "- Gradient calculation: in progress")
         (debug "- Weight updates: pending")
         (pending "Implementing gradient computation"))
       (actual-test)))
   ```

14. Test-Debug-Fix Cycle:
   a. Run Initial Test:
      ```bash
      clojure -M:test spec/path/to/test_spec.clj
      ```

Benefits of Pending Tests:
1. Clear development roadmap
2. Documentation of intended functionality
3. Progress tracking
4. Prevents test rot
5. Maintains focus on current task
6. Helps with estimation

Best Practices for Pending Tests:
1. Always include expected behavior documentation
2. Keep pending test count visible
3. Regularly review and update pending status
4. Use pending tests for feature planning
5. Include expected implementation timeline
6. Document dependencies between tests
